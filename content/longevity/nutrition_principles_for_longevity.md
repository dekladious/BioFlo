# Nutrition Principles for Longevity

## 1. Nutrition as a lever, not a religion

Nutrition advice is noisy and often tribal. BioFlo's approach is:

- Evidence-informed.
- Practical and flexible.
- Anchored in a few core principles that matter most for healthspan.

We care less about labels like "keto" vs "high-carb" and more about:

- Energy balance over time.
- Protein adequacy.
- Micronutrient sufficiency.
- Metabolic health.
- Sustainability in your real life.

## 2. Energy balance

Over months and years, body weight and fatness are primarily influenced by:

- **Energy in** – calories consumed.
- **Energy out** – basal metabolism + movement + exercise + other processes.

Chronic surplus (more in than out) tends to:

- Increase body fat.
- Worsen insulin resistance and metabolic markers.
- Raise risk for the Four Horsemen.

Chronic extreme deficit (much less in than out) can:

- Reduce lean mass and bone density.
- Harm hormonal health.
- Make long-term adherence unlikely.

BioFlo Coach will:

- Help you understand your rough energy landscape.
- Encourage sustainable changes, not crash diets.
- Prioritise muscle preservation if fat loss is a goal.

## 3. Protein

Protein is critical for:

- Building and maintaining muscle.
- Supporting recovery from training.
- Healthy aging and functional capacity.

General educational ranges often cited for active adults aiming to preserve or build muscle:

- Roughly **1.6–2.0 g of protein per kg of body weight per day**, adjusted for context and medical advice.

The exact number for you depends on:

- Age
- Activity level
- Body composition
- Medical conditions

BioFlo Coach will:

- Encourage distributing protein across meals.
- Highlight high-quality protein sources (animal and/or plant-based depending on your preferences).
- Remind you to discuss substantial dietary changes with your doctor or dietitian if you have kidney disease or other relevant conditions.

## 4. Micronutrients and food quality

Calories and macros are not the whole story.

We also care about:

- Vitamins
- Minerals
- Essential fatty acids
- Fibre
- Phytonutrients

Patterns that generally support micronutrient sufficiency:

- Plenty of vegetables and fruits across the colour spectrum.
- Whole-food sources of fats (e.g. olive oil, nuts, seeds, fatty fish depending on diet).
- Minimising reliance on ultra-processed foods and sugary drinks.

Restrictive diets (very low carb, very low fat, vegan, etc.) can be compatible with health but may require:

- Careful planning to avoid micronutrient gaps.
- Lab monitoring and supplementation under professional guidance in some cases.

BioFlo Coach can:

- Flag potential deficiency risks based on patterns you describe.
- Encourage getting personalised advice from a dietitian or clinician.

## 5. Carbs, fats, and personalisation

For many people:

- A wide range of carb/fat distributions can work as long as:
  - Energy balance is sensible.
  - Protein and micronutrients are covered.
  - The pattern is sustainable.

Some individuals do better with:

- Lower-carb approaches (e.g. for appetite control or certain metabolic issues).
- Higher-carb approaches (e.g. for performance in some sports, personal preference, or cultural reasons).

BioFlo will not insist on a single "correct" pattern. It will:

- Help you experiment in a structured way.
- Encourage regular lab checks and medical input if you have metabolic disease.

## 6. Food environment and behaviour

Often, what derails people is not knowledge but environment:

- Constant exposure to hyper-palatable, processed foods.
- Emotional or stress eating habits.
- Sleep deprivation driving cravings and hunger.
- Social settings where overeating is the norm.

BioFlo Coach will:

- Help you identify triggers and patterns (late-night snacking, "all-or-nothing" mentality, etc.).
- Suggest environmental tweaks (e.g. what you keep in the house, pre-planning meals).
- Tie nutrition to sleep, stress, and mood rather than treating it in isolation.

---

## 7. Supplements – cautious and minimalist

Supplements can be:

- Helpful in specific, targeted situations.
- A distraction or waste of money when used blindly.

BioFlo's general stance:

- **Food first** where possible.
- Supplements considered as:
  - Tools to fill known gaps (e.g. vitamin D in low-sun environments).
  - Adjuncts, not core pillars.

The coach will:

- Encourage you to ask:
  - What problem is this supplement meant to solve?
  - Is there evidence that it helps?
  - How will I know if it's working or not?
- Suggest discussing supplement stacks with your doctor, especially if:
  - You take medications.
  - You have known medical conditions.
  - You are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning pregnancy.

It will not prescribe supplement regimens or tell you to stop prescribed treatments.

## 8. Special situations and safety

Some people require extra care around nutrition changes:

- Those with:
  - Eating disorders (current or past)
  - Diabetes or significant metabolic disease
  - Kidney, liver, or gastrointestinal diseases
  - Pregnancy or breastfeeding
  - Major underweight or unexplained weight loss

In these cases, the coach will:

- Avoid aggressive restrictive advice.
- Strongly recommend working with your medical team and possibly a registered dietitian.
- Focus on supportive behaviours (sleep, gentle movement, stress tools) while deferring specific nutrition prescriptions to clinicians.

The overall idea:

> Use nutrition to support energy, mood, muscle, and metabolic health — in a way that fits your life and is safe for your particular medical context.
