# Sleep Principles – BioFlo Sleep & Recovery Framework

## 1. Why sleep is non-negotiable for longevity

Sleep is not "nice to have" recovery; it's a core biological process that influences:

- Brain function and memory
- Metabolic health and insulin sensitivity
- Cardiovascular risk
- Immune function
- Emotional regulation and stress resilience

Chronic poor sleep makes almost every health outcome worse. Improving sleep is often one of the highest-ROI changes people can make.

## 2. How much sleep do most adults need?

Population data suggest that:

- Most adults function best with **around 7–9 hours of sleep per night**.
- Because you don't sleep every minute you're in bed, this usually means aiming for about **8 hours in bed** for many people.

There is variation, but consistently sleeping far less than this is associated with worse outcomes for:

- Metabolic health  
- Cardiovascular health  
- Mental health and cognition  

BioFlo Coach will:

- Encourage you to experiment with giving yourself enough sleep opportunity.
- Help you notice how sleep quantity and quality affect your energy, cravings, and mood.

## 3. Anchor point: consistent wake time

One of the most powerful tools for better sleep is surprisingly simple:

> Pick a realistic **wake time** and stick to it every day, including weekends as much as possible.

This:

- Trains your body clock (circadian rhythm).
- Helps build predictable **sleep pressure** across the day.
- Makes it easier for bedtime to stabilise naturally.

BioFlo will often start by:

- Helping you choose a wake time that fits your life.
- Encouraging you to get out of bed at that time (no long snoozing or phone scrolling in bed).

## 4. Sleep environment and pre-sleep routine

### 4.1. Environment

Key principles:

- **Dark** – minimise light in the room (especially blue/white light).
- **Cool** – slightly cooler than daytime room temperature helps the body downshift into deeper sleep.
- **Quiet** or consistent sound – use earplugs or a sound machine if helpful.

Practical suggestions:

- Remove or cover bright clocks and LED indicators.
- Consider dimming lights in the hour before bed.
- Keep TVs and laptops out of the bedroom where possible.

### 4.2. Wind-down routine

Your brain needs a clear transition from "doing" to "resting".

Helpful patterns:

- A consistent sequence of low-arousal activities (stretching, reading a physical book, light journaling).
- Avoiding work emails, intense social media scrolling, or arguments just before bed.
- Treating bed as a place for sleep and intimacy, not for long periods of wakeful screen time.

BioFlo Coach can help you design a pre-sleep ritual that fits your preferences.

## 5. Substances and timing: caffeine, food, alcohol

### 5.1. Caffeine

- Blocks adenosine, a chemical signal that builds sleep pressure.
- Has a long half-life; it can still be in your system many hours later.

General guidance:

- Avoid caffeine too close to bedtime; many people do best with a **cut-off 8–10 hours before bed**.
- Pay attention to:
  - Afternoon coffee/energy drinks.
  - Hidden sources (pre-workouts, sodas, some supplements).

### 5.2. Food

- Large meals very close to bedtime can:
  - Raise body temperature.
  - Cause discomfort or reflux.
  - Disrupt sleep architecture.

Patterns that often help:

- Finish larger meals a few hours before bed where feasible.
- Avoid going to bed either very over-full or painfully hungry.

### 5.3. Alcohol

Alcohol tends to:

- Fragment sleep.
- Reduce REM and deep sleep quality.
- Elevate resting heart rate and body temperature.

Even small amounts later in the evening can degrade sleep quality, which many people see directly on trackers.

BioFlo Coach will:

- Encourage you to observe patterns (e.g. how sleep metrics and how you feel change with alcohol).
- Suggest limiting alcohol close to bedtime, especially if you're working on serious sleep or metabolic issues.

## 6. Sleep, stress, and metabolic health

Short or poor-quality sleep makes:

- Insulin resistance worse.
- Appetite and cravings harder to control.
- Emotional regulation more difficult.

BioFlo will often prioritise:

- Stabilising sleep **before** trying to overhaul diet and exercise all at once.
- Teaching simple nervous system regulation tools (breathing, relaxation) that can be used both during the day and at night.

---

## 7. When to seek professional help

Some sleep problems need medical evaluation:

- Loud snoring, gasping, or pauses in breathing witnessed by others.
- Extreme daytime sleepiness despite adequate time in bed.
- Unusual behaviours during sleep (acting out dreams, violent movements).
- Long-standing insomnia where you:
  - Worry excessively about sleep.
  - Spend hours awake in bed.
  - Feel desperate or hopeless about sleep.

In these cases, BioFlo Coach will:

- Suggest a conversation with your doctor and potentially a sleep specialist.
- Avoid prescribing detailed protocols that belong in clinical care (e.g. for sleep apnea or complex insomnia).
- Focus on general education and stress tools while you seek proper evaluation.

## 8. Sleep tracking and mindset

Sleep trackers can be useful, but they are not perfect:

- They estimate stages and metrics using algorithms.
- They can sometimes increase anxiety if you obsess over every number.

BioFlo Coach will:

- Use tracker data as one input among many.
- Emphasise how you **feel and function** during the day.
- Encourage a flexible, compassionate mindset toward nights that aren't perfect.

The aim is not "perfect sleep scores," but:

- Enough good-quality sleep most nights.
- A body and mind that feel supported, not depleted, by your sleep habits.
