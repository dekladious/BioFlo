# The Four Horsemen – Major Chronic Disease Risks

> Educational only, not medical advice. Diagnosis, screening, and treatment decisions must be made with your healthcare provider.

## 1. Why focus on the "Four Horsemen"?

In developed countries, a relatively small set of chronic disease clusters causes most serious disability and death:

1. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease  
2. Metabolic disease  
3. Cancer  
4. Neurodegenerative disease

BioFlo calls these the **Four Horsemen** not to scare you, but to:

- Make the threats concrete.
- Help you see where your own risk might be higher.
- Show how everyday decisions about movement, sleep, nutrition, and stress can shift the odds.

## 2. Horseman 1 – Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease

### What it is

- Diseases caused by plaque building up inside arteries:
  - Coronary artery disease (heart attacks)
  - Cerebrovascular disease (strokes)
  - Peripheral artery disease

Over years, fatty and inflammatory material accumulates in vessel walls, making them narrower and more fragile. At some point, a plaque can rupture and trigger a clot that blocks blood flow.

### Key risk themes

- Elevated **atherogenic lipoprotein particles** (e.g. ApoB-containing particles)
- Elevated blood pressure
- Smoking
- Poor metabolic health (insulin resistance, diabetes)
- Family history and certain genetic variants
- Inactivity, poor diet, chronic stress, poor sleep

### Biomarker concepts (education-only)

The coach may discuss:

- Standard lipids (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides)
- ApoB as a count of atherogenic particles
- Certain genetic markers like lipoprotein(a)
- Blood pressure
- Markers that reflect metabolic health (glucose, insulin, etc.)

BioFlo will **never** interpret a single lab for diagnosis. It will:

- Help you understand **what a test measures**.
- Encourage you to discuss abnormal results or strong family histories with your doctor.

## 3. Horseman 2 – Metabolic disease

### What it is

Metabolic disease includes:

- Insulin resistance
- Metabolic syndrome
- Prediabetes
- Type 2 diabetes

The core issue is that your cells become less responsive to insulin. Over time:

- The pancreas pumps out more insulin to keep glucose in range.
- Eventually, glucose levels rise.
- Damage accumulates in blood vessels, nerves, kidneys, and other organs.

Metabolic disease heavily amplifies risk for:

- Heart disease
- Stroke
- Some cancers
- Dementia

### Contributing factors

- Excess energy intake relative to output
- Low muscle mass and low activity
- Poor sleep quantity/quality
- Chronic stress and highly processed diets
- Genetic predisposition

### Biomarker concepts

The coach may mention:

- Fasting glucose
- Fasting insulin
- HbA1c (a longer-term glucose marker)
- Triglycerides, HDL, waist circumference

Again, BioFlo will frame these as **signals** not diagnoses, and will consistently recommend involving your doctor if results or symptoms are concerning.

## 4. Horseman 3 – Cancer

### What it is

Cancer is not one disease, but many. Common features:

- Cells accumulate genetic changes that:
  - Allow uncontrolled growth.
  - Prevent normal "stop" and self-destruct signals.
  - Enable invasion and spread to other tissues.

Risk is influenced by:

- Genetic background and family history.
- Environmental exposures (e.g. tobacco smoke).
- Hormonal and metabolic factors.
- Chance.

### Why early detection matters

In many cancers:

- Local or early-stage disease can often be treated or cured.
- Once cancer is widely spread, long-term survival rates drop dramatically, even with aggressive therapy.

Screening decisions are individual and depend on:

- Age, sex, family history, and personal risk factors.
- Guidelines in your country.
- Shared decision-making with your doctor.

BioFlo Coach can:

- Explain general concepts of early detection.
- Encourage age-appropriate preventive care and screening conversations.
- Reinforce known lifestyle levers:
  - Avoiding tobacco.
  - Maintaining metabolic health.
  - Being physically active.

It will not recommend specific screening schedules or interpret scans/biopsies.

## 5. Horseman 4 – Neurodegenerative disease

### What it is

Neurodegenerative diseases involve progressive loss of brain cells and function. The most common:

- Alzheimer's disease
- Other dementias and degenerative conditions

Symptoms can affect:

- Memory and learning
- Planning and judgment
- Orientation and awareness
- Behaviour and mood

Only a small fraction of cases are fully "pre-programmed" by rare genetic mutations. For most people, genetics influence risk but do not guarantee disease.

### Risk and protective factors

Research suggests that the following are linked with brain health risk or protection:

- Cardiorespiratory fitness
- Strength and muscle mass
- Sleep quality and regularity
- Metabolic health and vascular health
- Education and cognitive engagement
- Social connection
- Certain gene variants (like APOE subtypes)

Again, BioFlo treats this as risk education, not destiny.

## 6. What you can influence (without playing doctor)

For each Horseman, there are levers under your control:

- **Movement**
  - Zone 2 cardio
  - VO₂max-oriented work when appropriate
  - Strength and stability training

- **Body composition and muscle**
  - Building and preserving muscle mass
  - Avoiding large, sustained energy surplus

- **Metabolic health**
  - Supporting good insulin sensitivity through sleep, activity, and nutrition patterns.

- **Sleep**
  - Consistent schedule
  - Enough time in bed
  - Dark, cool, low-stimulation sleep environment

- **Stress and emotional health**
  - Skills to regulate the nervous system
  - Social support and meaningful connection
  - Reducing chronic, unrelenting stress where possible

- **Avoiding clear harms**
  - Not smoking
  - Limiting heavy alcohol intake
  - Using appropriate sun protection

BioFlo Coach will help you **prioritise and execute** on these basics in a sustainable way. It will not:

- Promise disease prevention.
- Replace screening, imaging, or treatment decisions with online advice.

## 7. Safety and language the coach should use

When discussing the Four Horsemen, BioFlo Coach should:

- Use conditional phrasing:
  - "May increase risk"
  - "Is associated with"
  - "Could help reduce risk"
- Make it clear that:
  - Risk is probabilistic, not guaranteed.
  - There is no way to eliminate risk entirely.
- Encourage professional care if:
  - The user reports worrisome symptoms (chest pain, neurological changes, rapid weight loss, etc.).
  - The user has strong family history and has not been evaluated.

The tone should be:

- Calm and non-alarmist.
- Empowering: "Here are the levers in your control."
- Respectful of uncertainty and individual variation.
